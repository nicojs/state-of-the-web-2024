### Since last time

- Nico.js gave a talk on Angular 2 in 2016
- Simon and Sander gave a redelivery of Angular Connect in 2019



---

### The past few years though...

- Standalone APIs
- Change detection using `OnPush`
- SSR and SSG with `@angular/ssr`
- Vite enables a much nicer DX
- Control flow syntax with `@if` and `@for`
- Angular Material switched to MDC-based components
- A fancy new reactive primitive, signals!
- Type-safe forms
- More TypeScript strictness: `null` checks, no implicit `any`s
- More functional notations: no more classes for route guards, route resolvers, HTTP interceptors
- `.ng`?
